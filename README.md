　　古巷的石板路留住几何踪迹，或许无人能计。你流过来，我走往日，往返穿越。那蹦蹦跳跳的小孩，你是下学还家吗？那打着碎花伞的长发女子，你轻移莲步，何以脸上泪水涟涟，是否方才震动了春愁，体验了离伤？那蹬着送煤车的丈夫，你黑沉沉的脸上满是汗水却何以飘荡着快乐的笑脸，是否又给浑家儿童赚取了少许钞票？那扶持着的老头子，您们渐渐而行，笑意融融，是在雨巷中漫步，重演一回恋情的放荡吗？那些踪迹磨亮了石板，映照出年轮的影子，一代又一代，一年又一年。
　　听风看月，没有你欣喜不复展示，一切风中的月华如云暗淡，眼儿媚的木香藤花瓣到处飘散。梅林烦恼仰望，全力专注屏息，脑际里惟有你凄惨开放绝世的相貌，鲜艳欲滴而灿烂。你那期盼的眼光如深沉蓝天，如许娇媚，如许秀美，又如许边远。看月听风，风中的你在月华里姹紫嫣红犹如水晶石般靓丽刺眼，明媚的你在风中秀美多姿。月色中的你在四月份夜里轻捷曼妙地打开一地的浅黄、纯洁、滴绿、淡紫、清蓝、洋红的笑容，你一如花瓣中的贼星雨，纷繁坠落在梅林精神深处的紫荆园。
　　我内心痛哭，更加自咎，特殊懊悔，即使早领会她会如许，起码临死前给她一点安慰，让她感触一点和缓，感触本人这个伙伴太低劣。回屋翻出抽斗里她的来函和那张已成遗像的相片，久久不许面临。
/ > at the time of writing this article, I actually thought and to write the word it is not a distance.
Starting from a dynamic, and tread the land began to imagine the long journey, at that time, not sure what to write, just in the mind have some sort of distantly stirring, like the kind of the process of seed germinate in the underground.
And I feel there are too many images to grain and symbolic, let me think of flowers, the thought that spring, think of the bees, think of the fruit, thinking about life, think of chasing the garden of love.
Often in communication with the spirit of some friends, slowly into the quiet state, in the blundering world, which is between person and person a necessary part of life and the mind.
Even the sound, even music, also turned into a quiet at the moment.
In this peaceful state, there are many things is the most resistant to taste, I don't know since when does the sky up a very small rain, a little like a soft wind kissed their cotton in mid-air all, this kind of weather for a writing, the mood is vulnerable to infection.
The window and looked at, traffic flow, mixed interweave, let a person feel the world never still busy, eyes under the boundless sky aimless wandering, as in seeking and fit into each other's heart, a moment.
At this time, I always imagine the streets of the city into a river, to think of myself as a happy fish, my this kind of imagination is often the reality of some noise was broken, blocking the road to continue to travel, this place, they call it "safety island, and I'm not going to stay here.
I and the distance of the world is only a window, and this door window covers too much life scene image.
I worked in a poem written in such a sentence: people without regret/is a process rather than the result.
What this process includes, far beyond the start or end, in fact this is a distance, it is the life of the two extremes - connected in the life and death, it's origin, the world therefore gives the sense of beauty.
Like the land to the peasants, text is to the writer, farmers get food from the land, the author works with the text, farmers harvest food is not only the joy of the moment, is the usual Labour the days of their filling, excited and really make the writer, is constantly visited during the process of writing inspiration.
Often when a person think of my close friend, talk to her in an imaginary space, light up the candle on the table a beautiful poem, light coffee to levitate a gentle lingering piece of music, the affair has long been distance from another world, this is a picture of a dynamic oil paintings, and hazy, and clear, memory is like the montage in the movie in flashbacks in the heart, the first time the light body into my field of vision, like a sudden inspiration in writing, this is god's grace, this reminds me of the poem of dai: walked with oiled paper umbrella/stray alone in a long, long/and moments of the rain lane/I hope to meet with a lilac/knot with tragic girl.
She silently near/approach, and cast/heave a deep sigh a dreamlike vision/she across/as/like dream generally plaintive confused.
Dai writing "rain alley" situation at the moment of mood was so fit with me, and I also like dai looked at the endless rain lane is full of sad, confused and disappointed, don't get wet and hope this light fall raindrops her heave a deep sigh of eye?
An imaginary story moved me from time to time, and make me full of passion, make me get a pen write down this wonderful feeling.
For a in the two world through people, he is never tired of.
Like heart collision with objects in the interminable, doomed happy with pain, with the old saying says "happiness for leaning, that deposit", often entangled by this approximate dividing state, but I didn't mean to get rid of.
My journey and arrived in another post, the new landscape has a bit more beautiful, still is the beautiful image of her, is still her light, the color of her dress and I like the kind of extreme, beautiful and simple but elegant, she is the reality of the world live in an orderly fashion.
Occasionally there was a bird or two, is like concealed, and the mysterious from a foreign land birds, but was obscured by the river of charming lake, and become a secret angel, at the moment, what it wants to tell me?
The arrival of the I, destined to accept too much bitterness - and not make it orderly world trouble.
Will go into the state of peace, let's start a conversation in the calm.
We talk about the topic and he did not do, like just understanding of strange friend, also don't know each other's path, let a person look, how also don't like a pair of is looking for spiritual home of the birds.
Finally, my friends also join in, we began to drink tea, the tea is real, we began to drink, wine is true, the window is still the light rain, the rain is real, only we - or our imagination is not true.
I like sitting opposite you, you like sitting opposite me, although eyes can see the eyes, but the distance between the light years.
So was born the desire, then gave birth to beautiful, although the beautiful with grief, and this is very sweet sorrow.
Really there is no need to think of the future of things too much, just like a flower will open when it is the open and distance was originally a god give us the arrangement.
Men and women, in order to close the distance, in entwine, everyday life in the effort, ultimately futile.
Should have read some articles about living, about death, good revelation to target concept.
But more time, we are not living for himself, but for its own shadow, to other people's opinion, in order to decadent ideas, people even hang the guise of morality.
This imprison human cord will be cut off sooner or later, one day people of freedom will fully make public.
For history, today's life has been a powerful proof, imagine if the reverse dozens of ring rings now things and behavior, what would it be?
The society is, after all, progress.
It reminds me of a word, but I want to reverse it, the sun or the original, people's eyes to see the sun.
Enjoy the germinating spring to bring me to life, enjoy the distance to bring me to the beautiful feeling, in a state of the tranquility of the reminds me of a lot of, so, I began to write poetry, to write words.
Fly freely in the sky of my life, the mystery of the bird, perhaps the magpie is really come from heaven, intended to reveal the secrets of the kingdom to me, I wish to turn the bird also give us the human - our PuJia together we, between the heart and heart to this beautiful distance added a scenery.
Don't demanding what fleeting, earth-shattering, say something ordinary, a few calm day best, like the gigolo knit quietly, although only once a year, sometimes a day of rain.
I am not like Faust shouted 1: on time how good, please stay.
If so, we really finished.
